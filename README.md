## Project Organization:
- "{name}_Resources" : Folder with any csv or data files you want to save
- "{name}_work.ipynb" : Jupyter notebook for misc. draft work - like a sharable whiteboard
- "{name}_notes.txt" : Text file to record any observations 

We can make other notebooks and folders for work that we are merging together but this should be enough for each of us to just experiment with stuff.

The config_fred.py file has a a working API key for the fred database.
